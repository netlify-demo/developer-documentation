Welcome to the Netlify Developer Documentation Template! This is a <a
href='https://docusaurus.io' target='_blank'>Docusaurus</a> site that was
created and deployed just for you. It looks like a normal developer
documentation website, but it has some special features thanks to <a
href='https://netlify.com' target='_blank'>Netlify</a>.



## Direct-to-CDN Deployment

  <div class='icon-text__text'>This site is deployed directly to a CDN. Skip
  the server, forget about managing infrastructure, and never worry about
  scaling up your website again.</div>

</div>

## Continous Deployment


<div class='icon-text'>
  <img class='icon-text__icon' src='/docs/assets/feature-continuous-deployment-small.svg'/>

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Developer docs change a lot, so being able to
  publish easily and often is important. Netlify takes care of all the
  complicated deployment configuration for you. All you have to do is edit a
  text file and push a Git commit to trigger a deploy.</div>

</div>

<a class='button' href='/docs/edit-a-page'>Try it for yourself</a>




## Branch Builds


<div class='icon-text'>
  <img class='icon-text__icon' src='/docs/assets/feature-branches-small.svg'/>

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Maintaining a public code base inevitably leads
  to maintaining multiple versions of your developer documentation. Netlify
  makes this easy by letting you publishing individual Git branches to
  dedicated subdomains.</div>

</div>

<a class='button' href='/docs/edit-a-page'>Publish a new version of these docs</a>



## Access Control?? Collaboration??? TODO


<div class='icon-text'>
  <img class='icon-text__icon' src='/docs/assets/feature-branches-small.svg'/>

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Sometimes your docs aren’t for public
  consumption. You can enable password protection in Netlify’s admin panel in
  the blink of an eye.</div>

</div>
