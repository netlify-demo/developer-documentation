Welcome to the Netlify Developer Documentation Template! This is a <a
href='https://docusaurus.io' target='_blank'>Docusaurus</a> site that was
deployed just for you. It looks like a normal developer documentation website,
but itâ€™s got some special features thanks to <a href='https://netlify.com'
target='_blank'>Netlify</a>.






[ADN Icon]

This site is deployed directly to a CDN. Skip the server, and forget about
managing infrastructure. [Learn more about how Netlify
works](/docs/architecture-overview).



[Continuous Deployment Icon]

Developer docs change a lot, so being able to publish easily and publish often
is important. Updating this site is as easy as pushing a Git commit. [Try it
for yourself](/docs/edit-a-page).
